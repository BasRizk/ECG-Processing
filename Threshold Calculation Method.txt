In the Thresholding step, the threshold value is calculated using the average amplitude along the whole signal multiplied by single factor (avgmult), these factor was chosen experimentally
to be 1.25.

The avgmult value 1.25 is not very high nor very low, making it consider all signals, appropriately above average; bearing in mind that average would be lower than the average value of only
the R-Wave peaks as the signal's amplitude value is mostly low (far from the peak), hence low values influence heavily the total average value and we need a multiplier value (avgmult) that 
is greater than 1.
