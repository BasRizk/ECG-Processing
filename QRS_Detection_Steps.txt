1-Removing of Noise that occurs due to artifacts :-
	a) Using notch filter.
	b) Using band pass filter 0.1Hz-45Hz.

2-Overcoming baseline drifts :-
	a) Differentiating the ECG Signal after removal of noise using the equation in slide 20.
	b) Squaring the dervative of the original signal to amplify the output.

3-Smoothing the resulting signal using moving average window with size N(equation can be found in slide 22).

4-Setting the thereshold, using a proposed idea, above which we consider the peak value as R wave.
