The optimal N is 25 as the smoothed signal figures shows that the window size
is more similar to the width of the QRS wave than the 5, 15 window sizes;
in other words, the 25 words closely observes the widest QRS wave.

According to observation, as the 5, 15 shows more than one peak in the same
QRS but in the 25 window size the signal is more smooth with only one peak.
